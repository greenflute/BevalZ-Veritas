# Directory Structure

> How backend code is organized in this project.

---

## Overview

The project is migrating from a single historical script into a package while
preserving the public `paper_audit.py` command and import surface. New backend
boundaries should live under `veritas/`; the compatibility script should stay
thin.

## Module Organization

- Keep `paper_audit.py` as a compatibility entry point only.
- During migration, `veritas/legacy.py` may hold the full implementation so old
  tests and monkeypatches keep working.
- Add new code to the narrow `veritas/*` boundary that owns the concept:
  config, preflight, run, workspace, models, risk_rules, adapters, artifacts,
  failed_diagnostics, or renderers.
- Thin boundary modules that still delegate to `veritas.legacy` should import
  legacy inside the delegating function, not at module import time, unless a
  tested compatibility contract requires object identity.
- Production adapters for provider functions that have not moved out of legacy
  should use call-time legacy proxies so constructing `default_audit_adapters()`
  does not import `veritas.legacy`.
- Renderer-facing code should accept stable dataclass models or dictionaries and
  normalize at the renderer boundary.
- Avoid adding new orchestration logic directly to `paper_audit.py`.

---

## Naming Conventions

- Package modules use lowercase snake_case filenames.
- Boundary modules should expose a small `__all__` list.
- Compatibility exports should re-export existing implementation symbols rather
  than duplicating behavior.

---

## Examples

- `paper_audit.py` aliases `veritas.legacy` for historical `import paper_audit`
  compatibility while still running `veritas.legacy.main()` as a script.
- `veritas/models.py` owns `AuditFailure`, `AuditReportModel`,
  `EvidenceFinding`, and related lightweight dataclasses; `paper_audit` keeps
  compatibility by re-exporting the same class objects through `veritas.legacy`.
- `veritas/file_utils.py` owns `_safe_name`, `_json_load`, `_json_save`, and
  `_load_merged_json_dicts`; these remain re-exported through `paper_audit` for
  compatibility with existing tests and local scripts.
- `veritas/report_schema.py` owns strict LLM evidence schema parsing and
  normalization; `paper_audit` keeps compatibility by re-exporting the same
  parser function objects through `veritas.legacy`.
- `veritas/retry_commands.py` owns retry command builders used by failed
  diagnostics; `paper_audit` keeps compatibility by re-exporting the same
  function objects through `veritas.legacy`.
- `veritas/runtime_metadata.py` owns runtime clock metadata helpers used by
  reports and deterministic date checks; `paper_audit` keeps compatibility by
  re-exporting the same function objects through `veritas.legacy`.
- `veritas/artifacts.py` owns formal audit artifact path, limited-outcome, and
  coverage-blocking helpers; `paper_audit` keeps compatibility by re-exporting
  the same function objects through `veritas.legacy`.
- `veritas/failed_diagnostics.py` owns stable failed-audit JSON payload and
  failure-to-`AuditFailure` conversion helpers; Markdown/HTML formatting can
  remain in `veritas.legacy` until renderer dependencies are untangled.
- `veritas/html_utils.py` owns HTML escaping and script-safe JSON helpers used
  by renderers; these remain re-exported through `paper_audit` for
  compatibility while renderer extraction continues.
- `veritas/text_utils.py` owns shared text shortening and token similarity
  helpers used by follow-up generation, risk rules, references, and renderers.
- `veritas/local_analysis.py` owns local non-provider analysis helpers:
  Benford/numeric extraction, local statistical checks, and structure-aware text
  chunking. These helpers must remain deterministic and must not call LLMs or
  network providers.
- `veritas/project_files.py` owns supported text-file extension constants,
  project directory file discovery/classification, main-paper scoring, missing
  metadata detection, and run metadata normalization. Keep this boundary
  deterministic and filesystem-local; provider extraction remains elsewhere.
- `veritas/followups.py` owns PubPeer/comment and journal-letter language,
  tone, article-identity, issue-normalization, context-building, prompt
  construction, draft artifact load/save, and namespace-aware generation
  helpers. `veritas.legacy` may wrap namespace-aware functions with its own
  globals so historical `paper_audit.generate_followup_draft` monkeypatch
  behavior remains compatible.
- `veritas/versions.py` owns prompt, schema, adapter, and risk-rule version
  constants; compatibility modules should import these constants rather than
  redefining them.
- `veritas/config.py` owns runtime configuration loading/application helpers.
  Namespace-aware helpers let `veritas.legacy` preserve historical global
  monkeypatch behavior without making `veritas.config` import legacy.
- `veritas/desktop_gui.py` owns desktop GUI helper functions that do not require
  the Tk application class: labels, config snapshots, progress parsing, artifact
  preview, run summaries, and namespace-aware config/follow-up actions.
  `veritas.legacy` may keep `DesktopGuiApp` and wrap namespace-aware helpers
  with its globals while the GUI class is still in the compatibility layer.
- `veritas/production_adapters.py` may still call legacy provider functions
  that have not been extracted, but those calls should resolve legacy only when
  the provider method is invoked.
- `veritas/risk_rule_helpers.py` owns extraction-limited classification,
  OCR/table red-flag downgrade, check similarity/merge, and merged
  summary/conclusion helpers shared by risk scoring and renderers. Runtime-year
  future-publication checks also live there; legacy callers pass the current
  runtime year explicitly to preserve compatibility with existing monkeypatches.
- `veritas/risk_rules.py` owns `apply_risk_rules` and `merge_chunk_reports`;
  `veritas.legacy` re-exports the same function objects for `paper_audit`
  compatibility.
- `veritas/renderers.py` accepts `AuditReportModel` / `EvidenceFinding` and
  converts them before lazily delegating to the existing Markdown and HTML
  renderers.
- `veritas/run.py` exposes the run orchestration boundary without requiring
  callers to import the legacy module directly; the legacy run engine is loaded
  only when `run_audit(...)` is called.
- `veritas/web_runner.py` owns local Web Runner helper functions that do not
  require the `WebRunnerState` class: run timestamps/ids, history paths, safe
  run serialization, artifact summary extraction, local path picking, dropped
  file URI parsing, and namespace-aware config/default-output helpers.
  `veritas.legacy` may keep `WebRunnerState` and wrap namespace-aware helpers
  with its globals while the state machine remains in the compatibility layer.
